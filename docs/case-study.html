            <h2>Goal</h2>
            <p>A private daily photo journal; designed around security, simplicity, and ease-of-use.</p>

            <h2>Why</h2>
            <p class="muted">
                I've been wanting a journaling app that didn't cost an arm and a leg for basic features, and that I could trust wouldn't take my data. 
                After trying several options, I decided to build my own, and start the MAAM (Mobile App a Month) project. 
            </p>
            
            <h2>Design</h2>
            <p class="muted">
                I wanted a clean, minimal design that focused on the content. The app uses a simple
                home screen showing that day's entry, a expanded view for that day's image, 
                and a snippet of that day's entry. The app also includes a history view, allowing users
                to view multiple past entries at once. And filter between entries with photos, or starred 
                entries for those days that were particularly special.
            </p>

            <h2>Development</h2>
            <p class="muted">
                The app is built using SwiftUI, with a focus on iPhone in particular. I figured since your
                phone is always with you in today's world, it would make most sence to build it on that 
                platform.
                <br/><br/>
                The app uses CoreData to store entries locally, and CloudKit for optional iCloud sync. Keeping
                everything private and secure, with no third-party tracking or ads.
            </p>
